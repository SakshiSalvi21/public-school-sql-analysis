# Public School Data Analysis Using SQL

📅 **Project Duration**: February 2025  
🏢 **Institution**: Conestoga College  

## 📊 Project Description
This project analyzes public school data in Ontario to uncover patterns in distribution, governance, language preference, and school categorization. SQL was used for database querying, data cleansing, ERD design, and the creation of summary views.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Analyze school location distribution across Ontario.
- Identify language preference (English vs. French).
- Evaluate school types (Catholic, Public, Hospital, etc.).
- Study school board affiliations and governance.
- Design SQL schema and apply data cleaning and optimization.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Data Cleaning & Optimization
- ERD Schema Design
- SQL Views & CASE Logic

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `SQL/`: Schema creation and query files
- `Report/`: Project documentation (Word format)
- `ERD/`: Entity Relationship Diagram of the database

## 📈 Highlights
- Created a `School_Count_By_Board` view to summarize schools per board
- Used `CASE` logic to categorize Primary vs. Secondary schools
- Analyzed credit amount, board density, and regional representation
- Identified gaps in school governance and resource allocation

## 📌 Project Impact
This SQL-driven project supports educational planning in Ontario by helping decision-makers understand how schools are distributed across regions and governed under various boards. It promotes better resource allocation and infrastructure development.
